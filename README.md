## HOW IT WAS BUILT
- Built the web structure using HTML

- Used JavaScript for the countdown function as well as the input functions and click functions
- Also used JavaScript for exception handling. 

Such handling include:
- If Task input box is empty and the user tries to start the timer. It would alert the user to input a task by displaying the text above the timer.
- If the timer has started and the user clicks the start button, it would alert the user that the timer has already started and that they would need to reset the pomodoro to make any changes.
- It also check if the user inputs a task that is already in the tasklist and informs them the said task has already been added.
